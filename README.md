# Reduced genome size and chemosensory system genes may implicate narrower ecological niches and obligate hematophagy lifestyle of Hippobosca camelina (camel ked).

## Background

Hippoboscid flies, or keds, are blood-feeding ectoparasites that infest birds, mammals, and occasionally humans. They belong to the Hippoboscoidea superfamily and are closely related to the sheep ked. 
Despite their role in transmitting pathogens such as Trypanosoma and Anaplasma species, their vector competence remains underexplored.

Genomic studies have advanced insect behavioral ecology and vector control strategies. However, the genome of Hippobosca camelina, a camel-feeding ked, is absent from databases, limiting insights into its chemosensory system and host detection mechanisms. 
Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing targeted, eco-friendly vector management tools.

While olfactory-based strategies have been effective in controlling related species like tsetse flies, the chemosensory mechanisms of keds remain poorly understood. This project aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the genetic and molecular basis
of host detection in Hippobosca camelina, paving the way for improved control strategies.
